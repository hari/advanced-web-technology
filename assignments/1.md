# Assignment 1: Core Concepts Review & Calculator UI Styling

### üìÅ Folder Setup

Inside your `awt` folder, create a sub-folder named `assignments/`

```
awt/assignments/
```

### Part 1: Concept Review

Based on your skill self-assessment, review the following core web development concepts and document them in your own words.

Create a file named `concepts-1.md` inside the `assignments/` folder.

#### Minimum topics to review:

* HTTP Methods & HTTP Status Codes
* At least 4 CSS Selectors
* GIT Basics (`init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`, `clone`, `branch`)
* Callback & Higher-Order Function
* Array Methods: `filter`, `map`, `forEach`, `push`, `pop`

You may include more topics you reviewed personally.

#### Example format:

```
Callback ‚Äì A function passed into another function to be executed later.
Higher-order function ‚Äì A function that takes another function as a parameter or returns a function.
```

Once complete, commit and push the file to your GitHub repository. Make sure to write the topics in your own words, and include mnemonics or examples where helpful.

### Part 2: Styling the Calculator (Design Only)

Take the calculator we created in the class and apply proper layout and design using modern CSS.

#### Requirements:

* Use **CSS Grid** (preferred) or **Flexbox** for layout
* Experiment with different **CSS selectors**
* Follow the visual design based on the shared reference image
* Do not add functionality yet, focus only on HTML and CSS
* (Optional) Add `:hover`, `:active` style, and subtle animations wherever appropriate.

#### Folder structure:

```
awt/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ calculator/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html # the layout we created
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
```

Push this to your GitHub repository as well. You do **not** need to wait until the project is complete: keep pushing your progress regularly.

Make sure to create **meaningful commit messages** that reflect what you changed, such as:

```
Initialize calculator layout using CSS Grid
Style number and operator buttons
Adjust spacing and button sizing
```

This helps track your development process and improves your version control habits.
