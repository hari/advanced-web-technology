# Assignment #2: JSON API using Express + Prisma + HTML

## Goals

- Understand the differences between SQL (SQLite) and NoSQL (MongoDB) databases.
- Learn how Prisma simplifies working with various types of databases.
- Reinforce previously covered concepts: routing, ORM, middleware, JSON APIs, and Git basics.
- Understand how the frontend fetches and displays data from a backend API.

## Objective

Build a complete web project that:
- Uses **Prisma ORM** with **MongoDB**.
- Serves a **JSON API** using **Express.js**.
- Displays backend data on a **simple HTML page** using `fetch()`.
- Reinforces learning through **handwritten notes** on core concepts.

## Required Folder Structure (in `awt/assignments/project-1/`)

```
awt/assignments/project-1/
├── prisma/
│   ├── schema.prisma
├── public/
│   └── index.html      # frontend page
├── server.js           # main Express backend
├── package.json
├── .env                # database config
├── .gitignore          # ignore .env file, generated files, etc.
└── README.md           # (optional, for project summary)
```

## Task Checklist

### Backend (Express + Prisma)
- Initialize a Node.js project and install all required dependencies.
- Set up Prisma with MongoDB.
- Define a single model (e.g., `Quote`) in the Prisma schema.
- Run Prisma migrations to apply the model.
- Create an Express API with at least:
  - `GET /api/quotes`: returns all data.
  - (Optional) `POST /api/quotes`: adds a new entry.

### Frontend (HTML + JavaScript)
- Create a minimal HTML file.
- Use the `fetch()` API to call your backend endpoint.
- Render the data in a list, table, or other readable format.

## Concept Notes (Handwritten)

As you build the project, take handwritten notes on **at least five (5)** important topics.

Each note should briefly explain what you learned. For example:

> **Prisma:** I learned that Prisma is an ORM that lets us define models and interact with the database using JavaScript instead of raw queries. We used it to define a Quote model and perform CRUD operations.

Save your notes in a folder named `awt/notes/` and include it in your submission.

---

## Bonus (Optional)
- Add a form on the frontend to submit new entries.
- Implement loading indicators, error handling, and success states.
- Use environment variables via `.env` for MongoDB connection.
- Explore and use **Prisma Studio** to view/edit data visually.

---

## Submission Instructions
- Push the full project to **GitHub**.
- Include all necessary files and a proper folder structure.
- Upload your concept notes in **PDF**, **JPG**, or **PNG** format.
- Notes must be in your **own words**. Use examples or mnemonics where helpful.
- Sign the notes with your name and roll number.
- `Quote` is an example model. You can use any other data model instead of quotes.
- Carefully follow all provided guidelines.
